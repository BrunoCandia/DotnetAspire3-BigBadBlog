# BigBadBlog
The Big Bad Blog is a tutorial that demonstrates how to take a simple blog website with articles in markdown on disk, and make it into a large CMS.

## How this got started...

Our friend Arthur The Author wrote a simple blog engine with C# and ASP.NET Core Razor Pages so that he was using to write some notes and publish them with the Bootstrap CSS framework so that he could have a simple blog engine that looked ok.  It did the job for him and he could post new messages using markdown files that he wrote into the `Posts` folder and the engine would automatically discover, index, and present that content.

Arthur started to enjoy writing, and wanted to do more.  He wanted to share his blog with friends Annie, Chris, and Tyler.  He hoped they would start writing on his blog but it was getting a little more complicated.  He wanted to add security controls, thumbnail managements, comments, and so much more.

This workshop is our walkthrough of helping Arthur to take his simple blog engine and lift it up using .NET Aspire, .NET 8, GitHub, and Azure to make it into a publishing platform that he and his friends could use to share their stories with the internet.
